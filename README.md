# Time-Series-from-scratch
It includes the time series from scratch.
Basically here I have done the Time Series process in python from scratch.
First I have checked the dataset through ETS decomposition.
Following that I have found whether the time series is stationary or non stationary.
Then if the time series is non staionary then change it to stationary by differencing by making mean,variance or covarrience constant
